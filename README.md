#Lunch Time Project
---------

###Overview:
As a student at the University of Victoria, I constantly found myself googling the opperation hours for varrious food locations on campus. The purpose of this project is to collect this data, with the hope of eventually automating the process and displaying it in a user friendly way. 

This program uses Python and Beautiful Soup to scrape UVic webpages.
