#Lunch Time Project
================

###Overview:
As a graduate student at the University of Victoria, I constantly found myself googling the opperation hours for food locations on campus. The purpose of this project is to collect this data and eventually display it in a user friendly way. 

Inspired by the [uvic-lunch-o-matic by Chris Matthews](https://github.com/cmatthew/uvic-lunch-o-matic)
